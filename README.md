# Titanic---Visualization-of-survival-Analysis

      This is a repository for Titanic dataset analysis with machine learning  and  Power BI dashboard and other related files to provide comprehensive understanding of the dataset. And also visualize the survival analysis

# Introduction  

      The main objective of the analysis is to predict the survival status of passengers on board the Titanic using various features, including age, gender, ticket class, and other variables. The dataset includes information on 1309 passengers, which is a subset of the total 2,224 passengers and crew members who were on board the Titanic. The problem statement of the dataset is important because it provides insight into the factors that influenced passenger survival rates during the Titanic disaster.

# Conclusion

    My analysis of the Titanic dataset revealed that gender, passenger class, family size, and fare were significant factors in determining the survival of passengers onboard the Titanic. These findings provide valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival rates during the disaster. The cleaned and analyzed dataset can be used for further analysis and modeling to gain a deeper understanding of the Titanic disaster.
